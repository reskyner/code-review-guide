### Why code review?

@fa[quote-left](Code review is systematic examination ... of computer source code. It is intended to find mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase, improving the overall quality of software. ~ Wikipedia)

- Make sure it works
- Improve it
- Learn new things!

### Step 1: Create an issue

### For code review...
  
@ul

- Create new label 'code-review' (if not existing)
- Give it a meaningful title (e.g. add a comment to the MakeAFile class to explain use)
- Give it some context (e.g. I struggled to understand how you were making a new file. Adding a commant above the class would help me to understand)
- Assign it to the person that suggestes the change, and yourself
