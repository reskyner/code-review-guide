### Step 1: Create an issue  
@fa[quote-left](Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.)
<p></p>
#### Why?  
<p></p>
- An issue can be associated with a pull request, and automatically closes when pull request is merged

### For code review...
<p></p>
@ul
1. Create new label 'code-review' (if not existing)
2. Give it a meaningful title (e.g. add a comment to the MakeAFile class to explain use)
3. Give it some context (e.g. I struggled to understand how you were making a new file. Adding a commant above the class would help me to understand)
4. Assign it to the person that suggestes the change, and yourself
